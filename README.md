# Design Picker

I rely on different chrome extensions to identify fonts, color etc. from websites I find interesting.

This project is a simple chrome extension that copies FONT_FAMILY, FONT_SIZE, COLOR and BACKGROUND_COLOR from whererver you click on the page.


#Installation

- No bundlers are used as of now.
- Requires a static server like `live-server` or `static-server` to work on `popup.html` separately.
